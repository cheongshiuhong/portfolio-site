      By surveying 30 elderly users, this study draws on the
      Almere model to examine the elderliesâ€™ perceptions and usages of mobile phone applications to
      discuss the extent to which social psychological and socio-demographic factors influence
      their usage behaviour. 
      Through Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regressions and mediation
      analyses, it shows that usage is associated with perceived usefulness and anxiety. It also finds
      significant group differences between different age groups of elderly users and the number of
      generations living in household.

      Implemented a neural network solution for product category extraction from product titles, with zero/few-shot learning in consideration, translating to a model that scales well for adding new label categories in the future.
      Utilized and experimented with Word2Vec and GloVe embedding to vectorize natural language, which is then passed into GRU-based neural networks, measuring the context of the product title text against its label text, to ultimately categorize each title based on its cosine similarity.
